CSC120 Computer Programming I 2025 Spring

CSC120 Computer Programming I teaches its students the fundamental skills for programming in Java. By the end of the course, the students will learn the following:

. Using an interactive development environment for editing and executing programs
. The fundamental Java source code structure (classes and interfaces)
. Leaving comments to Java programs
. Compilation
. Importing codes from libraries
. Generating command-line outputs
. Reading data from files
. Write data to files
. Processing keyboard inputs
. Java data types (declarations and their scope) 
. Variables and constants (declarations and assignments)
. Procedural decompositions
. Passing data between methods
. Text formatting
. Using Mathematical functions in the standard library
. The boolean data type and conditional executions
. Creating menus using switch statements
. Using for-loops, while-loops, and do-while loops for repeated executions
. Throwing and handling exceptions
. Single-dimensional and multiple-dimensional arrays
. Writing object classes
. Instance variables and class constants
. Visibility of methods and variables
. Code extensions
. Inheritance and polymorphism
. Writing recursive methods
. Testing code units

The times to meet.
. Lecture Sections: TR 3:30-4:45 PM, Witten Learning Center 160
. Laboratory Sections: Ungar 305

The textbook. A copy of the textbook written by the lecture instructor Ogihara

. Ogihara M. (2018), Fundamentals of Java Programming, Springer International

will be available through the Blackboard site. Also,

. Reges S., Stepp M. (2020), Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach 5th Edition, Pearson

is a useful textbook.


Assessment. The course grade will be based on the following:
. Weekly Review Assignments - 10%
. Programming Project - 21%
. Laboratory Tasks (graded by the lab instruction team) - 33%
. Midterm Test (Tuesday or Thursday before the Spring break) - 12%
. Final Exam (2:00 PM - 4:30 PM; date TBD) - 24%

Laboratory Tasks: The laboratory sessions are held in Room 305 of Ungar. You must appear in the lab and work with the lab instructor and the lab section's TA to complete the lab task. Incomplete work will result in partial credit. The lab task will be posted by no later than Thursday in the previous week. You may work on the assignments before your lab, but you must demonstrate your knowledge of the code. Each lab assignment is graded in a 10-point scale.

Weekly Review Assignments: A set of review questions or review programming tasks will be assigned. Gradescope will be used for giving questions and collecting answers. You must submit the assignment through Gradescope by uploading your answer sheet. The deadline for submitting your weekly assignment will be Sunday 11:59 PM. Gradescope is

Midterm and Final Exams: These are timed tests.  Gradescope will be used for administerng the exams.  The students must come to the classroom to take them and submit their answers through the site.

Programming Project: The project will be given ahead of time. Each student must submit the code for the task and a document describing the code design.

Regarding the programming project and lab assignments, no late submissions will be accepted. Tardiness due to illness and family/athletic travels will be accepted if proper documentation is provided. The students must follow the university's guidelines for tardiness.

Collaboration/Consultation: Each assignment task must be completed individually. For non-exam items, the students may discuss among themselves what techniques could be applicable to solve them, but copying someone else's work with little modifications will be considered plagiarism. The code available through resources like StackExchange, YouTube, and ChatGPT is considered someone else's work.

The University of Miami Policy on plagiarism: The students must refer to the honor code. All students are bound by the Academic Integrity Policy, intended to promote and support an atmosphere conducive to learning. Each studentâ€™s work is to be their own unless express permission is given by the instructor. Additionally, while students are bound by the policy, faculty are also bound to report violations as offered in the policy. When there is a suspected violation, the university requires the instructor report the incident promptly to the Department Chair and submit an academic integrity reporting form. The report will be examined by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies of Arts and Sciences. Once the case has been reported, it leaves the hands of the instructor. The students are encouraged to refer to the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook.
